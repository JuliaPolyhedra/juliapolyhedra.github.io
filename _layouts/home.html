  <h2>List of libraries</h2>
  The following table provides a list of Polyhedra Manipulation Libraries.
  When they have a Julia library implementing the interface of `Polyhedra.jl` then the "Library" column shows the name of the library.

  Please let me know if you plan to write a new wrapper (or an implementation in pure Julia).
Since libraries use different algorithms, no library is better for every problem; [here](http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~avis/doc/avis/ABS96a.ps) and [here](http://bugseng.com/products/ppl/performance) are comparisons.
